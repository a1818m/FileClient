##What is this project?

* the client part of the file transfer system written based on Qt4.7 can realize the Demo of file transfer between remote computers.

##What is the meaning of this project?

* this project is a Demo I used to practice.
* you can use it as a file transfer tool (the current version is not user-friendly, not recommended).
* you can use it as your own exercise program to add functionality.

##pay attention to the point

* both the client and server parts are written by themselves, so if you need to use them, download both the client and server.
* the Qt project was established under VC++, not in QtCreator.
